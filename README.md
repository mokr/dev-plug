# dev-plug

A dev/demo project for local development of plug-* libraries. Uses `:local/root` of `tools.deps` to access such
libraries living in the same folder as this one.

Status:

* Experimental
* Work in progress

# GOTCHAS

### "Errors during project resolution" (when using :local/root)

> The following errors were found during project resolve:
> /Users/mokr/code/opensource/dev-plug/deps.edn:
> Manifest type not detected when finding deps for net.clojars.mokr/plug-ui
> in coordinate {:local/root "/Users/mokr/code/opensource/plug-ui"}

**Remedy:** Run `lein pom` in the `:local/root` project it complains about (`plug-ui` in example above)
